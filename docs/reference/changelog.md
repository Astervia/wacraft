## \[v0.1.0] – 2025‑05‑11

### 🎉 Added

- **First public release** of the complete stack.

    - Multi‑tenant architecture with PostgreSQL persistence.
    - Webhook relay & real‑time WebSocket feed for UI.
    - JWT‑based auth, super‑user account, RBAC scaffolding.

- **wacraft‑server‑lite** – same as wacraft-server but without supporter features.
- **wacraft‑client** – Angular 19 SPA
    - Chat inbox, contacts, templates, automations panel.
    - Dark/Light theme via Tailwind + Angular Material.
    - Internationalisation placeholders (`i18n`).
    - User management.
    - Webhook management.

    - `wait-text-message-match`, `respond-with-text`, `send-interactive-list`, etc.
    - OAuth handshake against wacraft‑server using `SU_PASSWORD`.

### Infrastructure

- Docker images published under **`astervia/`** namespace, tag `v0.1.0`.
- Static binaries for Linux x64/arm64, macOS, Windows.
- Helm chart skeleton and Docker Compose examples (`prod`, `lite`).

### Documentation

- Quick‑start guides: [Fast Production Deploy](../quickstart/production.md), [Binary + Vercel](../deploy/binary-vercel.md), [Docker Compose](../deploy/docker-compose.md), [Node‑RED integration](../deploy/node-red.md).
- Meta setup & webhook guides.
- Diagrams and screenshots in `/assets`.

### Breaking Changes

_N/A – initial release._

### Known Issues

- Using old version of Tailwind CSS in the client. Need to update to latest to speed up build.
- Since the Webhooks sent to the server by Meta pass through a synchronization mechanism, you cannot scale the server horizontally (multiple replicas). We might solve this issue with a service like [Redis](https://redis.io/) or [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).
